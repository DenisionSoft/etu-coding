# Product Classifier

This is a desktop classification database manager written in Java 17 with Gradle and Spring Boot. This project features a setup script for a Postgres database, which the desktop app then connects to, calling stored functions and procedures written in PLpgSQL. 

The app is a multi window GUI made with Swing and AWT as a Bean that communicates to Services and extended-from-JPA Repositories.

It was developed as a coursework for a Techniques and Tools for Information System Design course in ETU.
