# Coding tasks in ETU

This repository contains code for tasks (historically referred to as "labs") for all Computer Science courses I took at Electrotechnical University from the first semester up to today. Note that these are not all the CS courses I took, but only (some of) those that required coding.


## Structure

The repository contains a folder for each course.

Folders are named in the following format: `S[semester_number]. [course_name] ([language(s)])`

For example, `S1. Programming (C++)`.


## Overview

### S1. Programming (C++)
Introduction to programming in C++.

### *S2. Programming (C++)*
Repository for the coursework can be found [here](https://github.com/DenisionSoft/ETU-FileManager).

### S3. Algorithms and Data Structures (Python)
Code for tasks covering the basics of algorithms and data structures, with a coursework on Kruskal's algorithm.

### S3. Computer Systems Organization (C, C++)
Tasks focused on data representation in memory, pointers, interrupts and low-level programming.

### S4. Operating Systems (C++)
POSIX threads, semaphores, mutexes, shared memory, signals, channels, processes, etc.

### S5. Data Management (SQL)
This contains only the coursework, which was a database for a car service.

### S5. Intelligent Data Analysis (R)
Tasks covering the basics of data analysis and statistics. <br>
These tasks were done in collaboration with [Maria Machula](https://github.com/M-Masha).

### S5. Machine Learning (Python, Jupyter)
Four notebooks with code for tasks covering the basics of machine learning and statistics.

### *S5. Web Technologies (HTML, CSS)*
Repository for the coursework can be found [here](https://github.com/DenisionSoft/ETU-Website).

### S6. Big Data (Python)
Model training on big data using Random Forest algorithm from Apache Spark. <br>
These tasks were done in collaboration with [Maria Machula](https://github.com/M-Masha).

### S6. Object-oriented Programming (C++, Java)
Tasks of increasing complexity covering object-oriented paradigms in C++. <br>
Also contains a coursework, a GUI elevator simulator, in Java. <br>
These tasks were done in collaboration with [Maria Machula](https://github.com/M-Masha).

### S6. Information Systems Design Methods and Tools (Java, SQL)
A GUI in Java and Spring for a product classifier system with a database.<br>
This task was done in collaboration with [Maria Machula](https://github.com/M-Masha).

### S7. Computer Graphics (Java)
A GUI editor for simple 2D graphics in Java AWT.

### S7. Information Systems Design Methods and Tools (Java, SQL)
A continuation of a project from semester 6.

### S8. Real-Time Systems (C)
Tasks focusing on real-time systems, interrupts and timeouts.

### *Thesis Project*
A repository for the thesis project is in development and will be added later.
