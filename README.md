# Coding tasks at the Electrotechnical University

This repository contains code for tasks (historically referred to as "labs") for all Computer Science courses I took at the Electrotechnical University from the first semester up to today. Note that these are not all the CS courses I took, but only (some of) those that required coding.

## Structure

The repository contains a folder for each course.

Folders are named in the following format: `S[semester_number]. [course_name] ([language(s)])`

For example, `S1. Programming (C++)`.

## Overview

### S1. Programming (C++)
Introduction to programming in C++.

### *S2. Programming (C++)*
Repository for the coursework can be found [here](https://github.com/DenisionSoft/ETU-FileManager).

### S3. Algorithms and Data Structures (Python)
Code for tasks covering the basics of algorithms and data structures, with a coursework on Kruskal's algorithm.

### S3. Computer Systems Organization (C, C++)
Tasks focused on data representation in memory, pointers, interrupts and low-level programming.

### S4. Operating Systems (C++)
POSIX threads, semaphores, mutexes, shared memory, signals, channels, processes, etc.

### S5. Data Management (SQL)
This contains only the coursework, which was a database for a car service.

### S5. Intelligent Data Analysis (R)
Tasks covering the basics of data analysis and statistics. <br>
These tasks were done in collaboration with [Maria Machula](https://github.com/M-Masha).

### S5. Machine Learning (Python, Jupyter)
Four notebooks with code for tasks covering the basics of machine learning and statistics.

### *S5. Web Technologies (HTML, CSS)*
Repository for the coursework can be found [here](https://github.com/DenisionSoft/ETU-Website).

### S6. Object-oriented Programming (C++, Qt)
Tasks of increasing complexity covering object-oriented paradigms. <br>
These tasks were done in collaboration with [Maria Machula](https://github.com/M-Masha).
